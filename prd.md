**5. User Personas**

- **ML Engineers & Data Scientists:** Rapid prototyping, experiment tracking, model deployments, agent/cobot usage.
- **MLOps/Platform Engineers:** Workflow orchestration, infrastructure automation, monitoring, compliance configuration.
- **Business Analysts:** Access dashboards, reports, and low-code analytics tools.
- **IT/Security Teams:** Audit, compliance checks, RBAC policy enforcement.

***

**6. User Stories**

- As an ML engineer, I can launch and monitor model training jobs via a single portal or CLI.
- As a data scientist, I can view, compare, and reproduce past experiments.
- As an MLOps engineer, I can define deployment pipelines that auto-scale and monitor themselves.
- As a compliance officer, I can audit ML artifacts, data usage, and access logs.
- As a new team member, I can onboard quickly using project/pipeline templates and agentic guidance.

***

**7. Success Metrics**

- **Model time-to-production**: Days to deploy a new model drops by 50%+
- **Incident response**: Automated rollback/remediation on 90%+ of model/service faults
- **Compliance**: 100% coverage of audit traceability for all deployed models
- **User satisfaction**: 90%+ positive rating for onboarding and user experience

***

**8. Non-Functional Requirements**
